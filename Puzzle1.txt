Count number of rows in python using "csv" :
Source Code:
    import csv
    filename = "csv-sample.csv"
    counter = 0
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        read_csv = csv.reader(file)
        for i in read_csv:
            counter+=1
    print("The number of lines is : "+str(counter))



Count number of rows in python using pandas:
Source Code:
    import pandas as pd
    filename = "csv-sample.csv"
    data= pd.read_csv(filename)
    total_lines = (len(data)+1) 
    print("The number of lines is : "+str(total_lines))
    #since first line of the csv file is taken as header by pandas. so total lines = length of data + length of header i.e 1
